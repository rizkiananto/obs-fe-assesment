# React Frontend Assesment - OBS 

This is the result of my work for OBS React Frontend Assesment.

Deployed using Netlify, can check in :
- https://master--obs-assesment-akbar.netlify.app/
  
Tech Stack I use on this project : 
- ReactJS
- Typescript
- MaterialUI for UI Library
- Prettier
- ESlint

## Setup Locally
clone this repo first and then go to the folder and run
```npm run install```
can run the project using
```npm run dev```

### Prettier
to make your code more neat and clean, just use prettier command like this : 
```npm run format```
this will adjust your code format as your defined in `.prettierrc.cjs`. you also can modify the rules as you like in that file using this [perttier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options) as reference
