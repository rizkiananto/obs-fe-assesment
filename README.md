# React Frontend Assesment - OBS 

This is the result of my work for OBS React Frontend Assesment.
Using ReactJS, Typescript, Vite, and MaterialUI for UI Library

Deployed using Netlify, can check in :
- https://master--obs-assesment-akbar.netlify.app/

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Setup Locally
clone this repo first and then go to the folder and run
```npm run install```
can run the project using
```npm run dev```

### Prettier
to make your code more neat and clean, just use prettier command like this : 
```npm run format```
this will adjust your code format as your defined in `.prettierrc.cjs`. you also can modify the rules as you like in that file using this [perttier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options) as reference
